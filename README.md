Title: Object detection using YOLO machine learning algorithm.

    Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating the objects in images or videos.
    YOLO is a popular machine-learning algorithm used for object detection in a single pass.
    YOLO uses the conventional neural network algorithm and Python language for detecting the objects
